
Ecommerce Repeat Orders
================================================================================

Add the "repeating order" functionality to
e-commerce.  For example, if someone wants to purchase
a weekly loaf of bread without having to re-enter
the order each week, the repeating order module allows
the customer to enter the order once at which time
the shop admin can execute the weekly repeat of the order.
